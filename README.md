# MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATIONS
## Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in financial, project management, cost, and other forecasting models. A Monte Carlo simulator helps one visualize most or all of the potential outcomes to have a better idea regarding the risk of a decision.

### Consider an imaginary game in which our player ‘Jack’, rolls an imaginary dice to get an outcome of 1 to 100. If Jack rolls anything from 1–51, the house wins, but if the number rolled is from 52–100, Jack wins. Simple enough?
Before simulating the outcomes, let’s calculate the house edge. The house edge displays the advantage the casino has in winning the bet. It’s the casino’s average profit from a player’s bet.
Let’s suppose Jack bets $1 on this game.
</br>
Probability of Jack winning = 49/100
</br>
Probability of the casino winning = 51/100
</br>
Expected profit for the player= 1*(49/100)-1*(51/100) = -0.02 = -2%
</br>
Therefore, the house edge in our imaginary game is 2%. 
</br>
For comparison, the lowest house edge in European Roulette is 2.7%. 
</br>
In short, we have a better chance of winning in our imaginary game than in Roulette.
